        <p>Hey, I'm Ethan. I guess this is my personal portfolio! I heavily enjoy programming and designing projects and all that.
          I've been programming since around the 5th grade when I won three levels of my school's science fair using a script I wrote in Python.
          I am currently most comfortable with Java, though hopefully that changes soon because I have seen the light and realized that there are
          much better languages that I could be using all day every day. I also enjoy IT things and I am quite good at fixing issues, so don't
          hesitate to ask me!</p>
        <br><br>
        <p>While I was in high school, I was the Tech Manager for two years, during which time I was fully in charge and responsible for the school's
          auditorium during any events, mostly after school. I would operate lighting consoles, sound consoles, and much more to ensure that any
          event that happened in that auditorium went smoothly. I also got paid for my efforts, so I'd say it counts as work experience! I really enjoy
          theatre and I plan on getting back into it, though the path to that at SUU is paved with quite a few required classes. I was also a
          Drama Club Officer at my school and was registered with the International Thespian Society.</p>
