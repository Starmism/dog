            <p>
                Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Stephanie Ellis and I am 22 years old. I am currently a Sophomore at Southern Utah University
                studying Computer Science. I was previously a Piano Performance Major, but have since shifted my focus towards programming and 
                web development. I am also on the Dean's List for the College of Engineering and Computational Science.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have a variety of experience in different fields. At one point I taught piano lessons for several years. I've also worked in retail
                and customer service and participated in a few interships as a dental assistant in two dental offices. At one point I was pursuing a career
                in CNA work, and worked at an assisted living home for a while. I am now a fulltime student and have been working hard to improved my skills 
                in Java, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript so I can become a software developer in the future.
            </p>

            <h2>Piano and Clarinet</h2>
            <p>
                I started playing piano at the age of 9, and now have 15 years experience performing, teaching, and accompanying with the piano. With 
                the clarinet, I began playing in 5th grade and went on to participate in honor bands, marching band, and the high school and college wind 
                symphony.

                  Some of my musical abilities include:
                    <ul>
                      <li>Teaching music theory and basic instrumental skills</li>
                      <li>Performance and performing etiquette</li>
                      <li>Knowledge of the piano and clarinet</li>
                      <li>Aural skills, advanced dexterity, and advanced piano playing</li>
                    </ul>

            <h2>Programming</h2>
            <p>
                I only started programming this past year, but I have been putting a lot of time and practice into improving my skills. As a 
                Computer Science major, I have taken a variety of computer programming classes so far. I have built several programs in Java, and 
                have practiced building websites this semester. In fact, this website you are looking at now was built by me and my group for 
                our Web Development class! I am hoping to learn more about programming and learn more programming languages in the future.

                Some of the programming and markup languages I know are:
                  <ul>

                    <li>JavaScript</li>
                    <li>HyperText Markup Language</li>
                    <li>Cascading Style Sheets</li>
